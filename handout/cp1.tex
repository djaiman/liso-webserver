In this checkpoint, you will parse requests from a client like Opera, Firefox, or Chrome.
Instead of responding to the requests, your Liso server will simply try to identify whether to request is a valid HEAD, GET, or POST request.
If it is a valid HEAD, GET, or POST request, the server will `echo' the request back to the client.
Otherwise, it will return an HTTP response with 400 as the error code.

\vspace{5pt}

\noindent Your server MUST:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Correctly identify whether an HTTP HEAD, GET, or POST request is correctly formed  \item Handle multiple clients sending HTTP requests at the same time.
  \item Use {\tt select()} to accept incoming data.
  \item Use lex and yacc to parse the requests.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Getting Started}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Unpack the starter code and create a git repo (\texttt{tar -zxvf Project1\_starter.tar.gz; cd 15-441-project-1; git init}).

  \item Create a \texttt{select()}-based echo server handling multiple clients at once, building on the  starter code provided on autolab and the course website.  

  \item Specifically, your server must have the capability to parse HTTP 1.1 requests and classify them as ``good'' or ``bad'' based on the provided RFC~\cite{httprfc}. For all ``good'' requests, you will simply echo back the original request. For all ``bad'' requests, you will return an HTTP response with 400 as the error code.

  \item Test using our provided cp1\_checker.py test script (read that script and understand it too.)

  \item Finally, hand-in your
submission by the deadline and include all needed files as outlined in
\S\ref{sec:handin}.\\
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tips \& FAQ}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item To test `Valid' requests, we will specifically be using requests as formatted by Opera, Firefox, Chrome, or Apache Bench. In industry folks test web services on a tens or even hundreds of combinations of browsers and environments... we'll stick to just these four for this project.
      \item Note that Apache Bench expects a Content-Length: field on every reply -- even error messages.
      \item If the request is validly formed but not a HEAD, GET, or POST you may either reply with a 400 or a 501 error code for this checkpoint (in CP2 you must reply with a 501).
    \end{itemize}

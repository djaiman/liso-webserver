In this class you wil learn about Computer Networks, from bits on a wire or through radio all the way up to the design of applications that run over networks. 
In this project, you will start from the top with an application we are all familiar with: a web server.

You will use the Berkeley Sockets API to write a web
server using a subset of the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) $1.1$ Request
for Comment---RFC 2616~\cite{httprfc}.  Your web server will also implement
HyperText Transport Protocol Secure (HTTPS) via Transport Layer Security (TLS)
as described in RFC 2818~\cite{httpsrfc}.  The final part of the project will
implement the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) as described in RFC
3875~\cite{cgirfc}.  

You will gain experience in:
\begin{itemize}
  \item ... building non-trivial computer systems in C.
  \item ... complying with real industry standards as all developers of Internet services do.
  \item ... reasoning about the many tasks that application developers rely on the Internet to do for them.
\end{itemize}

In building this project, you will become familiar with HTTP, HTTPS, and CGI. Your Liso web server will be fully functional and capable of running interactive applications via its CGI interface. At the end of the a project the final test will be running a
simple python script to generate your own ASCII Art!

To guide your development process, we have divided this project into three key checkpoints.
